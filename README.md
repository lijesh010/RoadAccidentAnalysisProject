# Road Accident Dashboard
This project aims to create a road accident dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022, providing valuable insights and key performance indicators (KPIs) related to road accidents. The dashboard analyzes a dataset containing information about road accidents, casualties, vehicle types, road conditions, and other relevant factors. The data is stored in an Excel file with the extension .xlsx.

## Dataset Overview
◾ File Name: Road Accident Dataset.xlsx
◾ Rows: 307,974
◾ Fields/Columns: 21

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The road accident dashboard provides the following KPIs and insights:

### Primary KPIs:
1. Total Casualties: 
The total number of casualties that occurred after the accidents.
2. Casualties by Accident Severity: Breakdown of casualties by accident severity level (e.g., fatal, serious, slight).
3. Maximum Casualties by Vehicle Type: Identification of the vehicle type involved in accidents with the highest number of casualties.
### Secondary KPIs:
1. Casualties by Vehicle Type: Distribution of casualties based on the type of vehicles involved.
2. Monthly Trend Comparison: Comparison of the monthly accident trends between the current year and the previous year.
3. Maximum Casualties by Road Types: Identification of road types associated with the highest number of casualties.
4. Distribution of Total Casualties by Road Surface: Breakdown of casualties based on the road surface conditions.
5. Casualties by Area/Location and Day/Night: Analysis of the relationship between casualties and the time of day in different areas or locations.
